Here, you can copy the room's code and send it to your friends so you can watch videos synced.

First, make sure everyone in the room is loading the same video file. After, you can you can select your subititle track (supported formats are .vtt and .srt). Lastly, go ahead and start the video.

No more 1, 2, 3, START! Just pause and play the video as you seem fit. (aka whenever you've had too much 🍺 and just HAVE to pee, or you have to clean the Dorito dust off your hands)

Enjoy! 😊

## Known bugs/issues

- [x] Playing/pausing too fast makes a play-pause loop
- [ ] Seeking still not good when the video is already playing
- [ ] What happens when a new user joins a party that's already watching the video?
- [ ] When opening another instance of the app, it takes longer to load?
